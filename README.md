# EmailSubjectLineAnalysis

This project allows you to take a file of subject lines from emails, in addition to types of engagemnet that the email subject line saw (for example - an open, a click, an opt-out, etc) and analyze the most like subject line to be engaged with, and the most unlikely.

For the event data, I created a dictionary mapping events to numbers - this is specific to my dataset and will likely need to be modified.
